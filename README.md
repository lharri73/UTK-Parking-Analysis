# UT Parking Analysis

We seek to answer the question: Can collective systems be used to predict the most likely place to find an empty parking spot on campus?

Along the way, we'll find the answewr to many other statistics like
 - **How many parking areas** do people typically check before finding a parking spot?
 - **How long** do people spend parking?
 - What are the **most used parking areas**?
 - What is the **best policy to follow** when finding parking? Park closest to the building you wish to be at? Go the the largest garage? random?
 - Does UT **have enough parking** to support it's buidling capacity?
